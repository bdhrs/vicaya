# Vicaya

A research tool for Pāḷi and Buddhist topics.

You ask a question. The tool searches your Obsidian vault, the Pāḷi canon
(suttas, Vinaya, Abhidhamma, commentaries, sub-commentaries), your library
folders, YouTube talks, and the open web. It drafts an answer with full
citations, has a second model review the draft, and saves a single Markdown
note into your vault under `Vicaya/`. Notes link back to existing notes
on related topics, so the vault accumulates as a connected body of work.

The main skill is invoked as `/vicaya <your question>` inside Claude Code (or
any agent that reads a Markdown skill file). It runs as a single orchestrating
session that delegates the high-volume evidence-gathering phases to a gather
sub-agent — the sub-agent searches the sources and writes findings to a shared
scratch file, keeping the main session's context clear for synthesis and
review. No manual stage switching is needed. `skill/vicaya/SKILL.md` remains the
behavioral source of truth. For periodic maintenance, use `vicaya-improve` to
process run retrospectives into the improvement backlog.

## Sources

Each source is optional — if the tool or path isn't configured it is silently skipped.

| Source | What it searches |
|---|---|
| **Obsidian vault** | Your existing research notes |
| **Pāḷi canon** | Local SQLite DB — CST text, translations, commentaries |
| **Library folders** | One or more document trees (including Calibre libraries) indexed into a local SQLite FTS database; Calibre metadata (author, tags) is auto-detected and included |
| **Sanskrit (GRETIL)** | Local clone of the GRETIL corpus — Vedic, Epic, Upaniṣadic, and philosophical Sanskrit texts in IAST plain text |
| **YouTube** | Dhamma talks and sutta studies via a curated channel allowlist |
| **Web** | General search and page fetch |
| **Gemini cross-check** | Second model reviews the draft before the note is written |

## Setup

1. `cp .env.example .env` and edit the paths to match your vault, library,
   and canon database.
2. Install whichever of these you want to use: `obsidian` CLI, `yt-dlp`, `sqlite3`, `gemini` CLI.
   For richer text extraction from library folders: `pdftotext`, `ebook-convert` (ships with Calibre).
3. `uv sync` to install Python dependencies.
4. Symlink the main skill folder into your agents' skills directories. Using
   symlinks ensures that changes made in this repository are immediately
   reflected in all agents. If you use staged runs, symlink the staged sibling
   folders too: `vicaya-0-scope`, `vicaya-1-gather`,
   `vicaya-2-synthesize-review`, and `vicaya-3-complete`. If you use the
   retrospective improvement loop, symlink `vicaya-improve` too.

   **OpenCode:**
   ```bash
   # Symlink skills
   for skill in vicaya vicaya-improve vicaya-0-scope vicaya-1-gather vicaya-2-synthesize-review vicaya-3-complete; do
     ln -sf "$(pwd)/skill/$skill" ~/.agents/skills/$skill
   done
   # Symlink slash commands (for autocomplete)
   for cmd in vicaya vicaya-improve vicaya-0-scope vicaya-1-gather vicaya-2-synthesize-review vicaya-3-complete; do
     ln -sf "$(pwd)/config/opencode/commands/$cmd.md" ~/.config/opencode/commands/$cmd.md
   done
   ```

   **Antigravity CLI (`agy`):**
   ```bash
   for skill in vicaya vicaya-improve vicaya-0-scope vicaya-1-gather vicaya-2-synthesize-review vicaya-3-complete; do
     ln -sf "$(pwd)/skill/$skill" ~/.gemini/skills/$skill
   done
   ```

   **Claude Code:**
   ```bash
   for skill in vicaya vicaya-improve vicaya-0-scope vicaya-1-gather vicaya-2-synthesize-review vicaya-3-complete; do
     ln -sf "$(pwd)/skill/$skill" ~/.claude/skills/$skill
   done
   ```

   Open a fresh agent session after adding a new skill symlink; skill discovery
   happens when the session starts.

5. (Optional) Clone the GRETIL Sanskrit corpus for pre-Buddhist source search:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wujastyk/GRETIL-mirror.git ~/MyFiles/2_Resources/gretil
   ```
   Set `VICAYA_GRETIL_PATH` in `.env` to match. If skipped, Sanskrit source search is silently disabled.

6. Run `/vicaya <a question>` in Claude Code, OpenCode, or `agy`.

Full setup notes are in [`skill/vicaya/SKILL.md`](skill/vicaya/SKILL.md).

### Library folders search

Configure one or more document trees to index together into a single SQLite FTS
database. A Calibre library is just another library folder: when Vicaya detects
a `metadata.db` inside a folder it automatically prepends author and tag metadata
to each book's FTS text, so tag/author searches work through the unified index.

- `VICAYA_LIBRARY_FOLDERS`: one or more source paths, pipe-separated (`|`). May be local, external, or server-mounted.
- `VICAYA_LIBRARY_FOLDERS_INDEX`: a local SQLite index path outside this repository.
- `VICAYA_LIBRARY_FOLDERS_EXCLUDE` (optional): comma-separated folders to skip during refresh. Excluded subtrees are never walked, and a later unbounded refresh drops any rows previously indexed under them.

Normal research search uses only the SQLite index. Source files are touched
during `library-folders-refresh` or later manual inspection, not during
`search-library-folders`.

Build and verify the index after setting `.env`:

```bash
uv run tools/research_sources.py library-folders-check
uv run tools/research_sources.py library-folders-refresh
uv run tools/research_sources.py library-folders-refresh --retry-failed
uv run tools/research_sources.py search-library-folders "dhamma" --limit 5
uv run tools/research_sources.py library-folders-duplicates --samples 10
```

If [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) is installed, the same commands have
short recipes (run `just` to list them):

```bash
just lf-check                      # read-only preflight: config + index health (run before refreshing)
just lf-refresh                    # build/update the index by walking the tree (skips unchanged files; slow first run; add --limit N to bound it)
just lf-refresh-retry              # like lf-refresh, but also re-extracts previously-failed files (run once after adding extractor support)
just lf-search "dhamma" --limit 5  # full-text search the index
just lf-dups --samples 10          # read-only duplicate diagnostic
```

The first unbounded refresh may take a long time on a large or mounted tree
because it must walk and hash every accepted file. Search covers files where
text extraction succeeds; metadata-only files are still tracked for path,
hash, and duplicate diagnostics but are not searchable by body text. Optional
local tools such as `pdftotext`, `textutil`, `antiword`, `catdoc`, and
`ebook-convert` (ships with Calibre — handles the Kindle/Mobipocket family
`.mobi`, `.azw3`, `.azw`, `.prc`, `.lit`, `.pdb`, `.chm`, plus `.rtf`) improve
extraction coverage when installed. `.zip`, `.bz2`, and `.7z` archives are also
searchable: each archive is indexed as a single document whose text is the
concatenation of its text-bearing members (binary/noise members are skipped),
bounded by per-archive caps of 5,000 members, 2 GB uncompressed, and a 5-minute
wall-clock. A normal refresh skips files whose size and
mtime are unchanged, so after installing a new extractor re-run with
`--retry-failed` / `just lf-refresh-retry` once; later refreshes skip them again.

Duplicate handling is conservative. Exact byte duplicates and identical
normalized extracted text are collapsed by default; `--include-duplicates`
returns every member. Filename-only matches are surfaced as
`possible_duplicate_of` hints for the researcher to judge, not auto-hidden.
Junk names such as `metadata.opf` and `Picasa.ini` are filtered from those
hints.

### Obsidian CLI

The `obsidian` command is part of the Obsidian desktop app — install Obsidian
from https://obsidian.md and the CLI comes with it.

**The desktop app must be running** when the skill executes. If it is not open,
vault search and note creation are disabled (the skill falls back to writing
the note directly to the vault folder, which Obsidian indexes on next launch).

To start Obsidian silently in the background before running the skill:

| Platform | Command |
|---|---|
| macOS | `open -a Obsidian` |
| Linux | `setsid obsidian </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 &` |
| Windows | `Start-Process obsidian` |

Verify the CLI is reachable: `obsidian version`

## Autonomous agent setup

> These instructions are written for AI agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot,
> etc.) that need to set up this project without human intervention. Read this
> section in full before running any commands. Every step includes a
> verification check — do not proceed past a failed check without telling the
> user.

### 0 — Prerequisites check

Run the following and note what is missing:

```bash
which uv          # Python package manager — required
which obsidian    # Obsidian CLI — optional (vault search)
which ebook-convert  # Calibre — optional (extracts Kindle/Mobipocket ebooks in library folders)
which yt-dlp      # yt-dlp — optional (YouTube search)
which gemini      # Gemini CLI — optional (cross-check model)
python3 --version # system Python — only needed if uv is absent
```

`uv` is the only hard requirement. Install it if missing:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Install optional CLI tools only if the user wants those sources. Skip any
tool the user does not need — the skill degrades gracefully.

```bash
# yt-dlp (YouTube search + transcript)
pip install -U yt-dlp          # or: uv tool install yt-dlp

# Calibre (optional — provides ebook-convert for Kindle/Mobipocket extraction in library folders)
# Install Calibre from https://calibre-ebook.com/download; ebook-convert is included.

# Gemini CLI — requires Google AI Studio API key
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli   # or follow https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
```

The `obsidian` CLI is bundled with the Obsidian desktop app on some platforms.
Check `which obsidian`; if missing, the vault search source is disabled.

### Runtime requirements

Some sources require a desktop application to be open:

| Source | Requirement | Impact if not running |
|---|---|---|
| **Obsidian vault** | Obsidian desktop app must be running | Vault search and note-write are disabled; note is written directly to disk instead |
Tell the user about these requirements after setup is complete:
- If `VICAYA_VAULT_PATH` is configured: remind them to keep Obsidian open when
  running `/vicaya`.

### 1 — Python environment

```bash
uv sync
```

Verify:

```bash
uv run python -c "import youtube_transcript_api; print('ok')"
```

### 2 — Discover local paths

The `.env` file maps local paths to the user's local data. Discover them
automatically before writing:

```bash
# Obsidian vault — find the vault directory (contains .obsidian/)
find ~ -maxdepth 4 -name ".obsidian" -type d 2>/dev/null | head -5

# Library folders — find candidate root paths (may include Calibre libraries)
# Ask the user which directories to include before setting VICAYA_LIBRARY_FOLDERS.
# The index path (VICAYA_LIBRARY_FOLDERS_INDEX) should be local and outside this repository.

# Canon DB — tipitaka-translation-data.db (from dpd-db project)
find ~ -maxdepth 8 -name "tipitaka-translation-data.db" 2>/dev/null | head -3

# DPD DB — dpd.db (from dpd-db project)
find ~ -maxdepth 8 -name "dpd.db" 2>/dev/null | head -3

# GRETIL corpus — check if already cloned
find ~ -maxdepth 6 -name "gretil.html" 2>/dev/null | head -3
```

If any path is not found, leave that variable blank in `.env` — the
corresponding source will be silently skipped.

### 3 — Write .env

Copy the template and fill in the discovered paths:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with the values found in step 2. Use `~` for the home directory.
Example layout (adjust to actual paths):

```
VICAYA_VAULT_NAME=Obsidian
VICAYA_VAULT_PATH=~/Obsidian
VICAYA_LIBRARY_FOLDERS=
VICAYA_LIBRARY_FOLDERS_INDEX=
VICAYA_LIBRARY_FOLDERS_EXCLUDE=
VICAYA_CANON_DB=~/path/to/dpd-db/resources/tipitaka_translation_db/tipitaka-translation-data.db
VICAYA_DPD_DB=~/path/to/dpd-db/dpd.db
VICAYA_GRETIL_PATH=~/MyFiles/2_Resources/gretil
```

Verify the file was written and does not contain placeholder text:

```bash
cat .env
```

`.env` is gitignored and will never be committed.

### 4 — Run the test suite

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -q
```

Expected: all tests pass or are skipped (skipped = optional tool not
installed, which is fine). Zero failures.

If DPD-backed citation tests are skipped because `VICAYA_DPD_DB` is blank
but you did find a `dpd.db` in step 2, go back and fill in that path.

### 5 — Symlink the skill

To make the main skill available across all your agents while keeping it in
sync with this repository, create symlinks in the following locations. If you
use staged runs, create matching symlinks for `skill/vicaya-0-scope`,
`skill/vicaya-1-gather`, `skill/vicaya-2-synthesize-review`, and
`skill/vicaya-3-complete`. Also symlink `skill/vicaya-improve` if you want
the retrospective improvement loop available as an agent skill.

**For Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and Codex where `~/.agents/skills` is shared:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
ln -sf "$(pwd)/skill/vicaya" ~/.agents/skills/vicaya
ln -sf "$(pwd)/skill/vicaya-improve" ~/.agents/skills/vicaya-improve
```

**For Claude Code:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
ln -sf "$(pwd)/skill/vicaya" ~/.claude/skills/vicaya
ln -sf "$(pwd)/skill/vicaya-improve" ~/.claude/skills/vicaya-improve
```

**Verification:**

```bash
# Check Gemini/OpenCode
ls ~/.agents/skills/vicaya/SKILL.md
ls ~/.agents/skills/vicaya-improve/SKILL.md

# Check Claude
ls ~/.claude/skills/vicaya/SKILL.md
ls ~/.claude/skills/vicaya-improve/SKILL.md
```

If you ever move or rename this repository, you will need to re-run these
commands to update the symlinks.

### 6 — Final verification

```bash
# Resolve a known citation (requires VICAYA_DPD_DB to be set)
uv run tools/research_sources.py resolve-citation s0202m_mul 97
# Expected: { "human": "MN60 Apaṇṇakasuttaṃ para 97", ... }

# Search canon (requires VICAYA_CANON_DB to be set)
uv run tools/research_sources.py search-canon "dukkha" --limit 3
# Expected: list of CanonHit objects

# Check optional library folders configuration
uv run tools/research_sources.py library-folders-check
# Expected: JSON status; unavailable is fine when the source is not configured
```

Setup is complete when both return results without errors. The skill is
ready to use: `/vicaya <your question>` in Claude Code.
